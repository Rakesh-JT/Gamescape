# GameScape

GameScape is an open-world game engine where you can create and explore dynamic, procedurally generated worlds. The game features a robust environment generator, real-time multiplayer support, and endless landscapes to explore.

## Features
- Procedurally generated terrain using Perlin Noise
- Real-time multiplayer support (coming soon!)
- NPCs with basic AI
- Inventory and quest systems

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/GameScape.git

---

### 7. **Next Steps:**
- Start small with a basic terrain generator and player controls.
- Gradually add complexity: build NPCs, items, and quests, and then scale it up.
- Consider adding multiplayer functionality and dynamic events to increase player interaction.
